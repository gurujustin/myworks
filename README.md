<hr />

<img align="right" height = "150px" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*6tTjzXX0Z2oDKoASI2KYTQ.png" >

This is one of the big project, I have built NFT lending/borrowing system on Avalanche/Solana. You can lend and borrow NFT from this site and the price comes from the NFT oracle.

So you deposit this collateral, we see it belongs to collection X so the floor price is Y. We send 70% of Y (assuming the loan to value is 70%) and the loan begins. 

Now two things can happen (already coded in compound). Interest is accumulating, either you pay back the loan + interest and it sends your collateral back, or the loan + interest is too high and it sends it to a liquidation smart contract.
